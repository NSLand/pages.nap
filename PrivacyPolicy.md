Lunomia (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how our app handles user information.

### 1. No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Lunomia functions entirely on-device and does not transmit any user information to external servers.

### 2. Health Data

Lunomia reads sleep-related data via Apple HealthKit to provide insights and improve your sleep awareness. This data is accessed read-only and used solely within the app on your device.

We do not:

- Share HealthKit data with any third parties.
- Store any data on external servers.

### 3. Data Storage

All data is handled locally on your device. No information is uploaded or sent to us or any third-party service.

### 4. Third-Party Services

Lunomia integrates with Apple HealthKit, governed by Apple’s privacy policies. We recommend reviewing Apple’s HealthKit documentation for more information.

### 5. User Rights

Since Lunomia does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data to delete or export. You control your HealthKit data via your iPhone settings.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

Lunomia does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

### 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the app or this page.
